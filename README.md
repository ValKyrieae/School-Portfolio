# Kyrie Logins – School + Portfolio Projects

Hey there! This repo holds everything from my personal portfolio site to the projects I’ve done in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and more. It’s where I keep the work I’ve built from scratch (no templates here), and where I can track my growth while learning new tools and trying new things.

## 📁 Project Highlights

### 🌐 Portfolio Website  
Fully custom-coded site that shows off who I am and what I do — built with just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. Includes a popup interaction, 3D image cube, and links to everything else.

### 👶 Python Baby Name Generator  
Group project from my Python logic class — lets you randomly generate baby names and (soon) compare popularity on a chart. Uses real Social Security name data, tuples, loops, and input validation.

### 🔼 Classical Image Cube (HTML/CSS)  
An animated cube of classical sketches from my Java + web design class. Uses CSS 3D transforms, filters, and custom styling for a soft art-style vibe.

## 🛠️ Tech I’ve Used

- HTML + CSS (hand-coded, no frameworks)
- Python (Tuples, Random, Input Validation)
- Java (for logic and structure)
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)
- Google Fonts + UI details
- JavaScript (popup and interaction)

## 💡 Why This Exists

I didn’t want a portfolio that looked like everyone else’s — I wanted one that actually showed what I’ve done and how I’m growing. This repo is part reference, part sandbox, and totally mine. I’ve learned a lot through these builds (especially the hard way), and I wanted a space to keep track of that.

## 📌 What’s Coming Next

- More projects as I finish out my cybersecurity degree
- Better responsive styling (mobile-friendly)
- Charts + visuals for the baby name generator
- Python practice: log parsers, scripts, and maybe a weather project 👀
