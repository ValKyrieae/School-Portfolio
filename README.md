### Portfolio Website
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Includes a popup interaction, a marquee rotating image gallery, and links to my work
- Hosted using GitHub Pages

### Digital Forensics Capstone Project
- Simulated real-world evidence handling and forensic imaging
- Used a WiebeTech Forensic UltraDock for write-protect testing
- Verified evidence integrity with MD5 and SHA-256 hashes
- Investigated evidence drives with Autopsy and Ubuntu tools
- Analyzed Telnet/FTP logins and recovered deleted files
- Detected and cracked hidden files using StegSeek, StegDetect, and Bash scripts

**Tools Used:**
