Kyrie L – School + Portfolio Projects
Hey there! This repo holds everything from my personal portfolio site to the projects I’ve done in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, Digital Forensics, and more.
It’s where I keep the work I’ve built from scratch (no templates here) and track my growth while learning new tools and trying new things.

📁 Project Highlights
🌐 Portfolio Website
Fully custom-coded site that shows off who I am and what I do — built with just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. Includes a popup interaction, 3D image cube, and links to everything else.

🕵️‍♀️ Digital Forensics Capstone Project
Final capstone project simulating real-world evidence handling, forensic imaging, and analysis.

Key highlights:

Performed write-protect testing on evidence using a WiebeTech Forensic UltraDock to ensure data integrity.

Captured MD5 and SHA-256 hashes before and after imaging to verify no data alteration (crucial for court admissibility).

Investigated evidence drives using Autopsy (Windows VM) and Linux Ubuntu VM tools.

Analyzed Telnet/FTP logins, recovered deleted files, and uncovered hidden "Rhino" images related to the case scenario.

Used StegSeek and StegDetect for steganography detection and password-cracking attempts on hidden image files.

Automated steganography cracking using Bash scripting with StegCracker.

Tools Used:
Autopsy | StegSeek | StegDetect | StegCracker | Bash scripting

👶 Python Baby Name Generator
Group project from my Python logic class — lets you randomly generate baby names and (soon) compare popularity on a chart.
Uses real Social Security name data, tuples, loops, and input validation.

🧑‍💻 Cisco Switch Interface Lab (Packet Tracer)
Assignment from my networking class where I configured switches, trunk links, and VLANs using Cisco Packet Tracer.

What I set up:

3 Cisco 2960 switches (Switch0, Switch1, Switch2)

4 endpoint devices (3 PCs and 1 laptop)

Static IP addresses (192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.4)

Layered switch connections with trunk links

What I configured:

Set interface speeds and duplex modes manually

Disabled auto-negotiation to practice manual settings

Assigned all PCs and laptop to VLAN 1

Configured trunk ports between the switches without negotiation protocols

Verified network connections with ping tests and show commands

What I learned:

How access ports and trunk ports differ and when to use them

How VLAN misconfigurations can break communication (and how to troubleshoot)

That trunking must be explicitly configured — it doesn’t happen automatically

How to troubleshoot using switch LEDs and command-line tools
