# Kyrie Logins – My Portfolio Site

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio, built from scratch with just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It highlights my background in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and programming. I wanted something clean, professional, and actually mine — not just another template.


## What’s on the Site
- **Home** – Quick intro to who I am and what I do
- **Projects** – Real work I’ve done, including my digital forensics capstone and some coding projects
- **Resume** – My experience, education, and skills — plus a button to download the PDF
- **Popup interaction** – Because why not ask if you're human?

## Tools & Tech I Used
- HTML & CSS (no frameworks, all hand-coded)
- Google Fonts for the style
- JavaScript for the interactive popup
- GitHub Pages to host everything

## Why I Made This
I wanted a portfolio that reflected *me* — simple, to the point, and a place I could keep building on as I grow in this field. Also, it gave me a chance to practice and show that I know how to build something from the ground up.

## What I Might Add Later
- Make it responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Add animations or dark mode toggle
- Expand the Projects page with GitHub repos
- Add a contact form or about section

Thanks for checking it out!
